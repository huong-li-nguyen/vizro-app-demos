# vizro-app-demos

Hey! üëã 

My name is [Li](https://github.com/huong-li-nguyen), and this is my personal project space, where I'm sharing simple examples of [Vizro](https://github.com/mckinsey/vizro) apps for [MakeOverMonday](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/) and other fun data visualization challenges. 
It's a work in progress, so I'll be adding more examples as I go along.

I hope these examples help you get started exploring all the cool features of Vizro! ‚≠ê

üìö Vizro is a low-code framework based on [Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) that allows you to create beautiful dashboards. See the official [documentation](https://vizro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [repository](https://github.com/mckinsey/vizro) to learn more about Vizro.
